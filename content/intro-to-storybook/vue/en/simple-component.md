We‚Äôll build our UI following a [Component-Driven Development](https://www.componentdriven.org/) (CDD) methodology. It‚Äôs a process that builds UIs from the ‚Äúbottom-up‚Äù, starting with components and ending with screens. CDD helps you scale the amount of complexity you‚Äôre faced with as you build out the UI.

## Task

![Task component in three states](/intro-to-storybook/task-states-learnstorybook.png)

`Task` is the core component of our app. Each task displays slightly differently depending on exactly what state it‚Äôs in. We display a checked (or unchecked) checkbox, some information about the task, and a ‚Äúpin‚Äù button, allowing us to move tasks up and down the list. Putting this together, we‚Äôll need these props:

- `title` ‚Äì a string describing the task
- `state` - which list is the task currently in, and is it checked off?

As we start to build `Task`, we first write our test states that correspond to the different types of tasks sketched above. Then we use Storybook to create the component in isolation using mocked data. We‚Äôll manually test the component‚Äôs appearance given each state as we go.

## Get set up

First, let‚Äôs create the task component and its accompanying story file: `src/components/Task.vue` and `src/components/Task.stories.js`.

We‚Äôll begin with a baseline implementation of the `Task`, simply taking in the attributes we know we‚Äôll need and the two actions you can take on a task (to move it between lists):

```html:title=src/components/Task.vue
<template>
  <div class="list-item">
    <input type="text" readonly :value="task.title" />
  </div>
</template>

<script>
  export default {
    name: 'Task',
    props: {
      task: {
        type: Object,
        required: true,
        default: () => ({ id: '', state: '', title: '' }),
        validator: task => ['id', 'state', 'title'].every(key => key in task),
      },
    },
  };
</script>
```

Above, we render straightforward markup for `Task` based on the existing HTML structure of the Todos app.

Below we build out Task‚Äôs three test states in the story file:

```js:title=src/components/Task.stories.js
import Task from './Task.vue';

import { action } from '@storybook/addon-actions';

export default {
  component: Task,
  //üëá Our exports that end in "Data" are not stories.
  excludeStories: /.*Data$/,
  title: 'Task',
  //üëá Our events will be mapped in Storybook UI
  argTypes: {
    onPinTask: {},
    onArchiveTask: {},
  },
};

export const actionsData = {
  onPinTask: action('pin-task'),
  onArchiveTask: action('archive-task'),
};

const Template = args => ({
  components: { Task },
  setup() {
    return { args, ...actionsData };
  },
  template: '<Task v-bind="args" />',
});
export const Default = Template.bind({});
Default.args = {
  task: {
    id: '1',
    title: 'Test Task',
    state: 'TASK_INBOX',
    updatedAt: new Date(2018, 0, 1, 9, 0),
  },
};

export const Pinned = Template.bind({});
Pinned.args = {
  task: {
    ...Default.args.task,
    state: 'TASK_PINNED',
  },
};

export const Archived = Template.bind({});
Archived.args = {
  task: {
    ...Default.args.task,
    state: 'TASK_ARCHIVED',
  },
};
```

There are two basic levels of organization in Storybook: the component and its child stories. Think of each story as a permutation of a component. You can have as many stories per component as you need.

- **Component**
  - Story
  - Story
  - Story

To tell Storybook about the component we are documenting, we create a `default` export that contains:

- `component`--the component itself
- `title`--how to refer to the component in the sidebar of the Storybook app
- `excludeStories`--information required by the story but should not be rendered by the Storybook app
- `argTypes`--specify the [args](https://storybook.js.org/docs/vue/api/argtypes) behavior in each story

To define our stories, we export a function for each of our test states to generate a story. The story is a function that returns a rendered element (i.e., a component class with a set of props) in a given state---exactly like a [Functional Component](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/render-function.html#functional-components).

As we have multiple permutations of our component, assigning it to a `Template` variable is convenient. Introducing this pattern in your stories will reduce the amount of code you need to write and maintain.

<div class="aside">
üí° <code>Template.bind({})</code> is a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind">standard JavaScript</a> technique for making a copy of a function. We use this technique to allow each exported story to set its own properties, but use the same implementation.
</div>

Arguments or [`args`](https://storybook.js.org/docs/vue/writing-stories/args) for short, allow us to live-edit our components with the controls addon without restarting Storybook. Once an [`args`](https://storybook.js.org/docs/vue/writing-stories/args) value changes, so does the component.

When creating a story, we use a base `task` arg to build out the shape of the task the component expects, typically modeled from what the actual data looks like.

`action()` allows us to create a callback that appears in the **actions** panel of the Storybook UI when clicked. So when we build a pin button, we‚Äôll be able to determine if a button click is successful in the UI.

As we need to pass the same set of actions to all permutations of our component, it is convenient to bundle them up into a single `actionsData` variable and pass them into our story definition each time.

Another nice thing about bundling the `actionsData` that a component needs is that you can `export` them and use them in stories for components that reuse this component, as we'll see later.

<div class="aside">
üí° <a href="https://storybook.js.org/docs/vue/essentials/actions"><b>Actions</b></a> help you verify interactions when building UI components in isolation. Oftentimes you won't have access to the functions and state you have in context of the app. Use <code>action()</code> to stub them in.
</div>

## Config

We'll need to make a couple of changes to Storybook's configuration files, so it notices not only our recently created stories and allow us to use the application's CSS file (located in `src/index.css`).

Start by changing your Storybook configuration file (`.storybook/main.js`) to the following:

```diff:title=.storybook/main.js
module.exports = {
- stories: [
-   '../src/**/*.stories.mdx',
-   '../src/**/*.stories.@(js|jsx|ts|tsx)'
- ],
+ stories: ['../src/components/**/*.stories.js'],
 addons: [
    '@storybook/addon-links',
    '@storybook/addon-essentials',
    '@storybook/addon-interactions',
  ],
};
```

After completing the change above, inside the `.storybook` folder, change your `preview.js` to the following:

```diff:title=.storybook/preview.js
+ import '../src/index.css';

//üëá Configures Storybook to log the actions( onArchiveTask and onPinTask ) in the UI.
export const parameters = {
  actions: { argTypesRegex: '^on[A-Z].*' },
  controls: {
    matchers: {
      color: /(background|color)$/i,
      date: /Date$/,
    },
  },
};
```

[`parameters`](https://storybook.js.org/docs/vue/writing-stories/parameters) are typically used to control the behavior of Storybook's features and addons. In our case, we're going to use them to configure how the `actions` (mocked callbacks) are handled.

`actions` allows us to create callbacks that appear in the **actions** panel of the Storybook UI when clicked. So when we build a pin button, we‚Äôll be able to determine if a button click is successful in the UI.

Once we‚Äôve done this, restarting the Storybook server should yield test cases for the three Task states:

<video autoPlay muted playsInline controls >
  <source
    src="/intro-to-storybook/inprogress-task-states-6-0.mp4"
    type="video/mp4"
  />
</video>

## Build out the states

Now that we have Storybook set up, styles imported, and test cases built out, we can quickly start implementing the HTML of the component to match the design.

The component is still rudimentary at the moment. First, write the code that achieves the design without going into too much detail:

```html:title=src/components/Task.vue
<template>
  <div :class="classes">
    <label class="checkbox">
      <input type="checkbox" :checked="isChecked" disabled name="checked" />
      <span class="checkbox-custom" @click="archiveTask" :aria-label="'archiveTask-' + task.id" />
    </label>
    <div class="title">
      <input type="text" :value="task.title" readonly placeholder="Input title" />
    </div>
    <div class="actions">
      <a v-if="!isChecked" @click="pinTask">
        <span class="icon-star" :aria-label="'pinTask-' + task.id" />
      </a>
    </div>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
  import { reactive, computed } from 'vue';

  export default {
    name: 'Task',
    props: {
      task: {
        type: Object,
        required: true,
        default: () => ({ id: '', state: '', title: '' }),
        validator: task => ['id', 'state', 'title'].every(key => key in task),
      },
    },
    emits: ['archive-task', 'pin-task'],

    setup(props, { emit }) {
      props = reactive(props);
      return {
        classes: computed(() => ({
          'list-item TASK_INBOX': props.task.state === 'TASK_INBOX',
          'list-item TASK_PINNED': props.task.state === 'TASK_PINNED',
          'list-item TASK_ARCHIVED': props.task.state === 'TASK_ARCHIVED',
        })),
        /**
         * Computed property for checking the state of the task
         */
        isChecked: computed(() => props.task.state === 'TASK_ARCHIVED'),
        /**
         * Event handler for archiving tasks
         */
        archiveTask() {
          emit('archive-task', props.task.id);
        },
        /**
         * Event handler for pinning tasks
         */
        pinTask() {
          emit('pin-task', props.task.id);
        },
      };
    },
  };
</script>
```

The additional markup from above combined with the CSS we imported earlier yields the following UI:

<video autoPlay muted playsInline loop>
  <source
    src="/intro-to-storybook/finished-task-states-6-0.mp4"
    type="video/mp4"
  />
</video>

## Component built!

We‚Äôve now successfully built out a component without needing a server or running the entire frontend application. The next step is to build out the remaining Taskbox components one by one in a similar fashion.

As you can see, getting started building components in isolation is easy and fast. We can expect to produce a higher-quality UI with fewer bugs and more polish because it‚Äôs possible to dig in and test every possible state.

## Automated Testing

Storybook gave us a great way to manually test our application UI during construction. The stories will help ensure we don‚Äôt break our Task's appearance as we continue to develop the app. However, it is an entirely manual process at this stage, and someone has to go to the effort of clicking through each test state and ensuring it renders well and without errors or warnings. Can‚Äôt we do that automatically?

### Snapshot testing

Snapshot testing refers to the practice of recording the ‚Äúknown good‚Äù output of a component for a given input and then flagging the component whenever the output changes in the future. It complements Storybook because it‚Äôs a quick way to view the new version and check out the differences.

<div class="aside">
üí° Make sure your components render data that doesn't change so that your snapshot tests won't fail each time. Watch out for things like dates or randomly generated values.
</div>

A snapshot test is created with the [Storyshots addon](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/tree/master/addons/storyshots) for each of the stories. Use it by adding the following development dependencies:

```bash
yarn add -D @storybook/addon-storyshots jest-vue-preprocessor
```

Then create a `tests/unit/storybook.spec.js` file with the following in it:

```js:title=tests/unit/storybook.spec.js
import initStoryshots from '@storybook/addon-storyshots';

initStoryshots();
```

We need to add a line to our `jest.config.js`:

```diff:title=jest.config.js
module.exports = {
  ...
+ transformIgnorePatterns: ["/node_modules/(?!(@storybook/.*\\.vue$))"],
};
```

That's it. We can run `yarn test:unit` and see the following output:

![Task test runner](/intro-to-storybook/task-testrunner.png)

We now have a snapshot test for each of our `Task` stories. If we change the implementation of `Task`, we‚Äôll be prompted to verify the changes.
